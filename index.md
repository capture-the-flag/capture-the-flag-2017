# Rules

## How to join

Choose a team. Meet at your team's base by 6pm on Wednesday.

TEMPLE TEAM's base is behind the Temple - that's 12:00 side, towards deep playa. Look for a giant silver, green, and blue flag.

MAN TEAM's base is behind center camp - that's the 6:00 side of Ring Road, with all the murals. Look for a giant red and orange flag.


## The objective

The game is over when someone wins. A team wins when both flags are flying at their base.

## Active players

An active player must be wearing a WARRIOR SASH. This distinguishes players from the thousands of other participants that have no idea what the hell is going on.

Pick up your WARRIOR SASH at your team's base. They're reversable, wear it with YOUR TEAM's BATTLE CRY facing out, obviously.

## Wait, what's my team's Battle Cry?
