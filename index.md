# HERE ARE THE RULES OF THE GAME

consider reading them

## How to join

Choose a team. Meet at your team's base by 6pm on Wednesday.

TEMPLE TEAM's base is behind the Temple - that's 12:00 side, towards deep playa. Look for a giant silver flag.

MAN TEAM's base is behind center camp - that's the 6:00 side of Ring Road, with all the murals. Look for a giant red flag.

## Then what?

At your team's base, your FEARLESS LEADER will shout at you through a megaphone. You'll get a warrior sash. We'll go over the rules for people who haven't read them, which will be, like, everybody. We will recite each other poetry about what the Man/Temple means to us. You probably should write some.

A little before sunset, both teams will pick up their flags and head for the neutral zone. (Read on to find out where that is!) 

## The objective

The game is over when someone wins. A team wins when both flags are flying at their base.

## Active players

An active player must be wearing a WARRIOR SASH. This distinguishes players from the thousands of other participants that have no idea what the hell is going on. Players will also have no idea what's going on, but in a different way.

Pick up your WARRIOR SASH at your team's base. They're reversible, wear it with YOUR TEAM's BATTLE CRY facing out, obviously.

## Wait, what's my team's Battle Cry?

## The field of play

The field of play includes all of Deep Playa between the 10:00 and 2:00 streets, and all of the inner Playa stopping at Esplanade, and only into the City around Center Camp within the circle formed by Rod's Road.

Do not take the fucking flags into the city, we would never find them again. Esplanade is fine, Rod's Road and the area around Center Camp is fine, but only go into Camps within Rod's Road with some consent from the actual human people who are living or working in there.

The field is divided into two TEAM ZONES with a small NEUTRAL ZONE dividing them. The neutral zone includes all of the 9:00 and 3:00 roads between the lantern spires, and all of the space immediately surrounding the Man within whatever Man permimeter that's being enforced this year. 

Even though the Temple and Center Camp Cafe are in team zones, their insides are not part of the game. People in there are doing shit that might be more important than what we are doing. Do not actually try to take the flags into the Temple or Center Camp Cafe, or the Man Base either. Someone would almost certainly yell at us and they're way too big to get in there anyway. 

## Tagging

If you are in the opposing team's ZONE, and an ACTIVE PLAYER from that team touches you and declares "TAG!", then you must surrender your WARRIOR SASH to that player. You can't be tagged inside your own zone.

A TAG is a light quick touch on a non-private body part, you fucking tourist. No tackles, no hitting, no grabbing, no groping, no nonconsensual hugs, NO NONCONSENSUAL HUGS, no long weird caresses. Not unless the person you're tagging is that kind of friend. 

You cannot tag or be tagged in the neutral zone, or in the Temple or Center Camp Cafe.

You also cannot tag or be tagged outside the field of play - not in most of the city, and not outside of the Burning Man Event. Obviously.  (If somehow you find yourself playing this game outside the trash fence, be sure to say hi to Grover, Danimal, and the rest of the friendly Perimeter crew, I'm sure they'd love to know what you're up to.)

If you're in an art car, you can only tag or be tagged by somebody inside that same art car.

You can get a replacement warrior sash from your team's base, or, if your teammate is carrying one that they've captured, they can give it to you. 

If you aren't wearing a sash, you are not ACTIVE, which means that you CANNOT TAG and you CANNOT CARRY THE FLAG.

If you are carrying an extra sash, you can give that extra sash to ANY PERSON. SERIOUSLY. ANYBODY. You might want to tell them about the game though.

## Carrying the flag

The flag is big and heavy and it will generally take more than one person to carry it. You must all be wearing WARRIOR SASHES. Seriously. That's how the game works. Ritual is a function of belief, and if you want the ritual of this game to work right you'd best believe you cannot touch that flag without a sash.

If you are carrying the flag, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT HURTING ANYONE WITH IT. Seriously! This is heavy fucking object with significant leverage! If there is a human being in your way, you cannot go that way!

If you are tagged while carrying the flag, you must stop carrying it. Set it down carefully if your teammates can't continue to lift it without your help. This means that getting the flag out of the opposing team's zone will be REALLY HARD.

I know you want to take the flag on an art car, I KNOW, I want to do that too. But we can't, because then people on foot will try to get the flag, and then they will probably die. Don't take the flag on an art car. I'm sorry.

## Etiquette and Safety

This is Burning Man. Fire is still hot, heavy things can still fall down, getting hit by a vehicle is still unpleasant. Even if it looks like a tiny floating island. 

Respect the idea that other people do not necessarily know or care about what you are trying to do.

We're out of advice about etiquette and safety, though. Try to have some of both?

## Rules in Unforeseen Circumstances

I guess you'll have to argue about it. Good luck.

Or you could try raising the game coordinators by shouting! Or maybe radio?

## Radio

Is there any chance enough of us will have functioning Walkie Talkies that it's worth setting them up? No!

Are we gonna try anyway? Yeah okay.

* Game-wide channel: MURS Channel 1, Subchannel CTCSS 123.0 (also known as subchannel 18 or 3Z)
* MAN TEAM channel: MURS Channel 2, Subchannel CTCSS 123.0 (also known as subchannel 18 or 3Z)
* TEMPLE TEAM channel: MURS Channel 3, Subchannel CTCSS 123.0 (also known as subchannel 18 or 3Z)

Lots of cheapo radios can monitor two channels at a time. Do the obvious thing.

## Is this going to work?

I have no idea. I hope so. I hope we can make enough fucking sashes. I hope people show up. I hope people aren't assholes.

## Um, can I talk to you about all this?

Shit. I guess since we made this website we better take some responsibility. Ok. Email us at jmdolan@gmail.com and/or jes5199@gmail.com

## Who are you people?

So far, it's just Jenn and Jes doing most of the coordination and making the flags and bullshit. We've been burning since 2010, but this idea is brand new.
